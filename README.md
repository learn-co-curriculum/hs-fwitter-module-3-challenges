## Week 3 Challenges!

+ Add a delete link next to each tweet that deletes the tweet from your database. Hint: Every time you make a modification to your application you should be thinking about MVC and what needs to change in the M, the V and the C. (Hint 2: ActiveRecord has a built in method for deleting entries in your database. Google it. This means that your M is pretty much taken care of - now change the V and the C.)
+ Start exploring the ActiveRecord `.find_by` method. 
  * Figure out how to display tweets from just one certain user.
+ Hook up a database in your side project!
