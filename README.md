## Week 3 Challenges!

+ Add a delete link next to each tweet that deletes the tweet from your database. 
  * Hint: Every time you make a modification to your application you should be thinking about MVC and what needs to change in the models, the views and the controller.
  * Hint 2: ActiveRecord has a built in method for deleting entries in your database. Google it. This means that your M is pretty much taken care of - now change the V and the C.
+ Start exploring the ActiveRecord `.find_by` method. 
  * Figure out how to display tweets from just one certain user.
+ Dying to learn more about Rake tasks? Check out the All About That Rake lab on Ironboard.
