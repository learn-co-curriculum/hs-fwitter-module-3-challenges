## Week 3 Challenges!

First - Go back and complete today's ToDo. Then try any of the challenges below.

+ Check out the Ruby Labs section of Ironboard.

+ Set up a database in your Flatiron Swag Shop - look at the Flatiron Swag Shop on Ironboard for some guidance.

+ Start exploring the ActiveRecord `.find_by` method. 
  * Figure out how to display tweets in your Fwitter application from just one certain user.

+ Read up on [ActiveRecord validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) and set up validations for the length of tweets and for the uniqueness of a userâ€™s email address.

+ Add a delete link next to each tweet that deletes the tweet from your Fwitter database. This means you'll need to create a new route in your application controller and inside of that route you'll be asking your Tweet model/ActiveRecord to delete that specific tweet. 
  * Hint: ActiveRecord has a built in method for deleting entries in a database. Google it. 

+ Dying to learn more about Rake tasks? Check out the All About That Rake lab on Ironboard.
